==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-7*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 6.x to 7.0

":helpgrep" now uses a help window to display a match.


Minor incompatibilities:

For filetype detection: For many types, instead of ~/.dir/filename use
*/.dir/filename, so that it also works for other user's files.

":0verbose" now sets 'verbose' to zero instead of one.

Removed the old and incomplete "VimBuddy" code.

Buffers without a name report "No Name" instead of "No File".  It was
confusing for buffers with a name and 'buftype' set to "nofile".

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-7*

New data types						*new-data-types*
--------------

In Vim scripts the following types have been added:

	list		ordered list of items
	dictionary	associative array of items
	function	reference to a function

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.

NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!


KDE support						*new-KDE*
-----------

Kvim is the KDE version of Vim.  It uses the Qt toolkit.  See |KVim|.
(Thomas Capricelli, Philippe Fremy, Mickael Marchand, Mark Westcott, et al.)


MzScheme interface					*new-MzScheme*
------------------

The MzScheme interpreter is supported. |MzScheme|
The |:mzscheme| command can be used to execute MzScheme commands.
The |:mzfile| command can be used to execute an MzScheme script file.

Printing multi-byte text				*new-print-multi-byte*
------------------

The |:hardcopy| command now supports printing multi-byte characters.
The 'printmbcharset' and 'printmbfont' options are used for this.
Also see |postscript-cjk-printing|.  (Mike Williams)

New Syntax/Indent/FTplugin files: ~

Others: ~

Mac: Add the selection type to the clipboard, so that Block, line and
character selections can be used between two Vims. (Eckehard Berns)
Also fixes the problem that setting 'clipboard' to "unnamed" breaks using
"yyp".

Mac: GUI font selector. (Peter "Rain Dog" Cucka)

The netrw plugin now also supports viewing a directory, when "scp://" is used.
Deleting and renaming files is possible.  (Charles Campbell)

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-7*

":helpgrep" accepts a language specifier after the pattern: "pat@it".

Move the help for printing to a separate help file.  It's quite a lot now.

":breakadd here" and ":breakdel here" can be used to set or delete a
breakpoint at the cursor.

The tutor was updated to make it simpler to use and added text to explain a
few more important commands.  Used ideas from Gabriel Zachmann.

Unix: When libcall() fails obtain an error message with dlerror() and display
it. (Johannes Zellner)

Added "nbsp" in 'listchars'. (David Blanchet)

Added the "acwrite" value for the 'buftype' option.  This is for a buffer that
doesn not have a name that refers to a file and is written with BufWriteCmd
autocommands.

For lisp indenting and matching parenthesis: (Sergey Khorev)
- square brackets are recognized properly
- #\(, #\), #\[ and #\] are recognized as character literals
- Lisp line comments (delimited by semicolon) are recognized

Added the "count" argument to match(), matchend() and matchstr(). (Ilya Sher)

winnr() takes an optional "$" and "#" arguments.  (Nikolai Weibull, Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Added 'n' flag to search(): don't move the cursor. (Nikolai Weibull)

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-7*

Mac: "make" now creates the Vim.app directory and "make install" copies it to
its final destination. (Raf)

Mac: Made it possible to compile with Motif, Athena or GTK without tricks and
still being able to use the MacRoman conversion.  Added the os_mac_conv.c
file.

==============================================================================
BUG FIXES						*bug-fixes-7*

When using PostScript printing on MS-DOS the default 'printexpr' used "lpr"
instead of "copy".  When 'printdevice' was empty the copy command did not
work.  Use "LPT1" then.

The GTK font dialog uses a font size zero when the font name doesn't include a
size.  Use a default size of 10.

This example in the documentation didn't work:
    :e `=foo . ".c" `
Skip over the expression in `=expr` when looking for comments, |, % and #.

When ":helpgrep" doesn't find anything there is no error message.

"L" and "H" did not take closed folds into account.

Win32: The "-P title" argument stopped at the first title that matched, even
when it doesn't support MDI.

Mac GUI: CTRL-^ and CTRL-@ did not work.

"2daw" on "word." at the end of a line didn't include the preceding white
space.

Win32: Using FindExecutable() doesn't work to find a program.  Use
SearchPath() instead.  For executable() use $PATHEXT when the program searched
for doesn't have an extension.

When 'virtualedit' is set, moving the cursor up after appending a character
may move it to a different column.  Was caused by auto-formatting moving the
cursor and not putting it back where it was.

When indent was added automatically and then moving the cursor, the indent was
not deleted (like when pressing ESC).  The "I" flag in 'cpoptions' can be used
to make it work the old way.

When <Space> is mapped to something that starts with a space, typing <Space>
does not expand abbreviations.  Only disable expanding abbreviations when a
mapping is not remapped, not when the RHS starts with the LHS.

When opening a command-line window, 'textwidth' gets set to 78 by the Vim
filetype plugin.  Reset 'textwidth' to 0 to avoid lines are broken.

After using cursor(line, col) moving up/down doesn't keep the same column.

Win32: Borland C before 5.5 requires using ".u." for LowPart and HighPart
fields. (Walter Briscoe)

On Sinix SYS_NMLN isn't always defined.  Define it ourselves. (Cristiano De
Michele)

Printing with PostScript may keep the printer waiting for more.  Append a
CTRL-D to the printer output. (Mike Williams)

When converting a string with a hex or octal number the leading '-' was
ignored.  ":echo '-05' + 0" resulted in 5 instead of -5.

Using "@:" to repeat a command line didn't work when it contains control
characters.

When using file completion for a user command, it would not expand environment
variables like for a regular command with a file argument.

'cindent': When the argument of a #define looks like a C++ class the next line
is indented too much.

When 'comments' includes multi-byte characters inserting the middle part and
alignment may go wrong.  'cindent' also suffers from this for right-aligned
items.

The default for 'helplang' was "zh" for both "zh_cn" and "zh_tw".  Now use
"cn" or "tw" as intended.

When 'bin' is set and 'eol' is not set then line2byte() added the line break
after the last line while it's not there.

Using foldlevel() in a WinEnter autocommand may not work.  Noticed when
resizing the GUI shell upon startup.

Python: Using buffer.append(f.readlines()) didn't work.  Allow appending a
string with a trailing newline.  The newline is ignored.

When using the ":saveas f2" command for buffer "f1", the Buffers menu would
contain "f2" twice, one of them leading to "f1".  Also trigger the BufFilePre
and BufFilePost events for the alternate buffer that gets the old name.
