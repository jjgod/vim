The spell files included here are in Vim's special format.  You can't edit
them.  See ":help spell" for more information.


Copyright

The files used as input for the spell files come from the OpenOffice.org spell
files.  Most of them go under the LGPL or a similar license.

Copyright notices for specific languages are in README_??.txt.  Note that the
files for different regions are merged, both to save space and to make it
possible to highlight words for another region different from bad words.
